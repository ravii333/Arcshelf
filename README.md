## About ArcShelf 📚

ArcShelf is an open-source platform created to solve a common problem for students everywhere: finding previous years' exam papers. It provides a clean, centralized, and community-powered archive for mid-semester and final exam questions from various universities and colleges.

The core philosophy is simplicity and function over clutter. Inspired by minimalist documentation sites, ArcShelf focuses on making content accessible and easy to contribute.

### Core Features

- 📚 **Browse & Search:** Intuitively navigate papers through a University → College → Course hierarchy or use the search to find exactly what you need.
- ⬆️ **Community Contributions:** A streamlined submission form allows any student to upload exam papers (PDFs/Images) and contribute to the archive.
- ✨ **Modern Stack:** Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React with Vite, Node.js) for a fast and responsive experience.
- ☁️ **Cloud-Based:** All files are securely stored and delivered via Cloudinary for high performance and scalability.
- 🎨 **Clean & Responsive Design:** A modern, minimalist UI built with Tailwind CSS that looks great on any device.

This project is built by students, for students, with the goal of making exam preparation easier and more collaborative.
